Rules to declaration of variable in JavaScript
In JavaScript, the rules for declaring a variable are as follows:

1.  **Variable Declaration**: In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using the `let`,
`const`, or `var` keywords. The `let` and `const` keywords were introduced
in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and are used for block-scoped variables,
while the `var` keyword is function-scoped.

2.  **Variable Naming**: Variable names in JavaScript can contain letters, digits, underscores, and
dollar signs. However, they cannot start with a digit. Variable names are case-sensitive.

3.  **Variable Initialization**: Variables in JavaScript do not require initialization. You can declare a variable
without assigning a value to it, and it will be initialized with a value of `undefined`

4.  **Variable Hoisting**: In JavaScript, variables declared with the `var` keyword are
hoisted to the top of their scope, regardless of where they are actually declared. This means that
